Vision: Sustainable Infrastructure for AI-Empowered Open & Collaborative Decentralized Science

Mission:&#x20;

\[1] Build Infrastructure for Accelerating DeSci

\[2] Develop AI4DeSci Use-Cases with Scientific Impact

\[3] Promote DeSci Through Innovative Model and Actions&#x20;



Build Exclusively on Akash.network

1st Use case : app.plantamusica.cloud





To give a quick idea what its going to look like, currently it is composed of mainly two parts. First part is for **DeSci Cloud Collaboration**. Imagine Google Colab for Decentralized Science on Decentralized Cloud. Differing from the traditional Colab platform, here collaboration could be Human-Human, Human-AI-Agents, also between AI-Agents. Second Part is for **Science Crowdsourcing** to generate high-quality labelled data for AI, think about roboflow.com for annotation and labelling of DeSci & open-science related project data. Due to time restriction, most effort for use case and demonstration will be build for the above two main part. Marketplace will be a natural third component that will slowly follow through after the Hackathon. Template, tools, and auxiliary services will be what offered and traded/rented through the marketplace.
